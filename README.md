# Updates

Function get_column() was implemented to query a user specified column
and value in given file and return either user specified result column,
or the default column (column 2 of the file). 

Script print_fires.py was fixed to correctly use get_column function
and modified to accept all arguments from run.sh.

# Additions

Shell script run.sh was added to pass all input arguments to and then
run print_fires.py.
